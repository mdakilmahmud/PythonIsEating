# 🐍 PythonIsEating

# 🚀 Project Overview
PythonIsEating is a simple but engaging Snake Game built with Python and Tkinter. It was developed as a part of our university coursework at United International University (UIU) to strengthen our understanding of Python GUI programming, event handling, and basic game logic.

# 🎮 Key Features

✅ Classic Snake Gameplay — Control the snake with arrow keys, eat food, and grow longer.

✅ Random Food Spawning — Food appears at random positions each time.

✅ High Score System — Keeps track of the highest score across game sessions (high_score.txt).

✅ Pause & Restart — Pause the game anytime or restart for a fresh run.

✅ Custom Snake Color — Pick your favorite snake color using a built-in color picker.

✅ User-Friendly Interface — Start screen with a title and easy-to-use Play button.

# 🗂️ Project Purpose
This game was created to:

Practice Python programming beyond simple scripts.

Learn how to design and manage a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Implement real-time user input handling.

Use basic file I/O to store game data persistently.

Collaborate effectively as a team on a coding project.

# ⚙️ How to Run the Game
1️⃣ Clone or download this repository.

2️⃣ Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your system.

3️⃣ Run the game using:
python PYTHONISEATING.py

4️⃣ Play, pause, change snake colors, and try to beat the high score!

# 💡 What We Learned
Working on this project helped us understand:

The basics of Tkinter for building Python GUIs.

How to handle keyboard events in a game loop.

How to manage game state (like pause/resume).

How to use file operations for saving scores.

How to plan and divide work as a small dev team.
